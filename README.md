# Casinopolis
Stellaris mod that adds a new planet class: the Casinopolis. Similar to the Ecumenopolis, it is a planet fully encased in steel, however it is dedicated to vice and debauchery, satisfying every citizen's carnal needs.

## What it does
The Casinopolis is a planet type that is created through the Arcology project, identical to the Ecumenopolis. After acquiring the Arcology Project Acsension Perk, a decision is unlocked on planets that have solely housing districts. Completeing this project will turn the planet into a Casinopolis. 

The Casinopolis does one thing, and one thing only: make absolute bank. This is accomplished by the variety of districts available; Hotel, Casino, Brothel and Theatre. The Hotel is the sole way to build more housing for the planet, however it provides a huge amount. Casino and Brothel are the two money makers of the planet. The Casino provides both Croupier and Gambler jobs. The Brothel provides Prostitute jobs, and the Theatre provides Entertainer and Culture Worker jobs. Any unemployed on the planet will automatically be assigned to the Gambler job, regardless of strata.
